Changed value of parameter LogFile to MCLP-DMD-0-FAC-1943.log
   Prev: gurobi.log  Default: 
Optimize a model with 1 rows, 1943 columns and 1943 nonzeros
Variable types: 0 continuous, 1943 integer (1943 binary)
Coefficient statistics:
  Matrix range     [1e+00, 1e+00]
  Objective range  [0e+00, 0e+00]
  Bounds range     [1e+00, 1e+00]
  RHS range        [1e+02, 1e+02]
Found heuristic solution: objective 0.0000000
